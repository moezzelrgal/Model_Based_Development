## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my studies and projects related to Model-Based Development (MBD). Model-Based Development is an approach to system development where models serve as the primary artifacts throughout the development process. This README provides an overview of the contents of the repository and guidance on how to navigate through the different components.

## Introduction to Model-Based Development

Model-Based Development (MBD) is a methodology that uses models as the core artifacts in the development process. It involves creating abstract representations of a system and using these models for analysis, design, and implementation. This section provides a brief introduction to MBD and its benefits.

## [MATLAB](MATLAB) 

### LABs

#### [lAB 1: MATLAB concepts ](MATLAB/LABs/LAB1.m)

Objective: This lab exercise will help you practice essential MATLAB concepts, including
creating and manipulating numeric arrays, performing matrix concatenation, and using the
repmat function.

#### [lAB 2: MATLAB Control Structures - While and Switch ](MATLAB/LABs/LAB2.m)

Objective: In this lab, you will practice working with MATLAB's control structures, specifically the while loop and the switch statement.

#### [lAB 3: MATLAB Basics ](MATLAB/LABs/LAB3.m)

Objective: In this practical lab, beginners will learn and practice fundamental MATLAB concepts, including cell arrays, structures, character data, conditional statements (if), for loops, and basic plotting.

#### [lAB 4: Understanding MATLAB Function Concepts ](MATLAB/LABs/LAB4.m)

Objective: In this lab, you will learn and practice fundamental concepts related to MATLAB functions. You will create your own functions, understand function inputs and outputs, and explore common function features.


### Tasks

#### [Task 1: MATLAB Numeric Types and Array Manipulation](MATLAB/Tasks/Task_1.m)

Objective: In this task,  will create a MATLAB program that covers various aspects of MATLAB numeric types, creating numeric arrays, using specialized matrix functions, and matrix concatenation.

## [Simulink](Simulink)

### LABs

#### [lAB 1: Basic Simulink Blocks ](Simulink/LAB1)

Objective: In this lab,  will gain hands-on experience with fundamental Simulink blocks and learn how to create a simple simulation model.

#### [lAB 2: Basic Simulink Blocks ](Simulink/LAB2)

Objective: By the end of this lab, should be able to create and simulate a simple Simulink model, understand basic Simulink blocks, and connect them to build a functional system.
