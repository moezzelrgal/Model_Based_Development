# Model-Based Development 

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to my studies and projects related to Model-Based Development (MBD). Model-Based Development is an approach to system development where models serve as the primary artifacts throughout the development process. This README provides an overview of the contents of the repository and guidance on how to navigate through the different components.

## Introduction to Model-Based Development

Model-Based Development (MBD) is a methodology that uses models as the core artifacts in the development process. It involves creating abstract representations of a system and using these models for analysis, design, and implementation. This section provides a brief introduction to MBD and its benefits.

## LABs

### [lAB 1: [MATLAB]](LABs/lAB 1/)

Objective: This lab exercise will help you practice essential MATLAB concepts, including
creating and manipulating numeric arrays, performing matrix concatenation, and using the
repmat function.
% Define two matrices A and B
A = [3 2 1 ; 6 5 4 ; 9 8 7];
B = [12 11 10 ; 15 14 13 ; 18 17 16];

% Add matrices A and B
matrixSum = A + B;
disp(matrixSum);

% Create a row vector containing numbers from 1 to 5
rowVector = (1:5);

% Create a column vector containing numbers from 1 to 5
columnVector = (1:5)';

% Horizontally concatenate the two vectors
horizontallyConcat = horzcat(rowVector, columnVector');

% Create a 2x2 random matrix
originalMatrix = rand(2);

% Repeat the random matrix to form a 4x4 matrix
repeatedMatrix = repmat(originalMatrix, 2, 2);

% Create the identity matrix of size 3x3
identityMatrix = eye(3);

% Compute the product of the identity matrix and matrix A
matrixProduct = identityMatrix * A;
disp(matrixProduct);
